## Introduction

This project aims to analyze U.S. Census data to extract meaningful insights using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau. It contains detailed demographic information about the U.S. population.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/farneelu/Analyze-U.S.-Census-Data-with-Scipy-.git
cd Analyze-U.S.-Census-Data-with-Scipy-
python analyze.py

Libraries
This project uses the following libraries:

NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame to handle structured data efficiently.
Scipy: A library used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of functions that operate on NumPy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is used for plotting graphs and charts.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
Jupyter: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Results
The results of the analysis are presented in the form of charts, graphs, and statistical summaries. These results provide insights into the demographic trends and patterns in the U.S. population.
